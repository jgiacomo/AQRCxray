Description: This package provides utility functions and ggplot2 plotting themes.
    These are useful for working with XRF Data in the Crocker Nuclear Lab at UC 
    Davis. The package was put together to organize and avoid multiple copies of
    functions which were being used in multiple different analyses. Also, a
    plotting theme, with consitent colors, was put together to make plotting of
    XRF data more consistent. These functions and plotting themes will hopefully
    be helpful in reducing code copying and in report consitency.
